# D12_D-FF2JK-FF

The most commonly used flip-flop conversion in digital circuits is the conversion from D flip-flop to JK flip-flop. This is because the JK flip-flop has more functionality than the D flip-flop and can be used in a wider range of applications. 

The conversion from D flip-flop to JK flip-flop involves connecting the Q output of the D flip-flop to the J input of the JK flip-flop and connecting the complement of the Q output to the K input of the JK flip-flop. This creates a feedback loop that allows the JK flip-flop to toggle its output state when both J and K inputs are high.

Another commonly used flip-flop conversion is the conversion from SR flip-flop to JK flip-flop. This conversion involves connecting the S input of the SR flip-flop to the J input of the JK flip-flop and the R input of the SR flip-flop to the complement of the K input of the JK flip-flop. This conversion eliminates the problem of the illegal state in the SR flip-flop and provides more functionality to the circuit.
